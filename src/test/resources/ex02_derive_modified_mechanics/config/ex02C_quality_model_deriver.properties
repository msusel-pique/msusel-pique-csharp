#### Config file for CSharp QATCH Quality Model Derivation

### Path to quality model description file
qm.filepath=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/quality_model/ex02C_qm_design_benchmark.json

### Path to benchmark repository directory
benchmark.repo=C:/Users/David/Repository/msusel-pique/benchmark-repository-csharp-five

### Path to directory containing the comparison matrices.
comparison.matrices=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/comparison_matrices

### Temporary path to file to fill with tool scan analysis results. 
# This should be a filename path such as a/b/benchmark_data.csv.  
# Does not need to initially exist.
benchmarkscan.output=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/out/ex02C/benchmark_data.csv

### Temporary path to desired directory to hold the output of running the R Thresholds script.
rthresholds.output=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/out/ex02C

### Temporary path to directory to store the weights.json file generated by R analysis.
rweights.output=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/out/ex02C

### String flag, usually a file extension, that signals that a project to be analyzed is within the directory the flag was found in. 
# For example, ".sln".
target.flag=.sln

### Path to directory to place the derived quality model.
results.directory=src/test/resources/ex02_derive_modified_mechanics/out/ex02C
